Encourage quality content by sharing the revenue!

== Description ==

Reward the hard work of your authors by sharing Amazon Associate revenue on the specific posts of each site contributor. This encourages authors to write more high quality material because they know they will earn more! 

This plugin automatically changes any Amazon link with the appropriate affiliate ID based on the sharing rules that you set. It also localizes to the visitor's local Amazon so you can make even more money with earnings from multiple countries.
